## Features

- **Add Visited Countries:** Users can input the name of a country they have visited, and the application will add it to their list of visited countries.
- **View Visited Countries:** The application displays the list of visited countries for the currently selected user.
- **Switch Users:** Users can switch between different users to view and manage their respective visited countries.
- **Dynamic Color Theme:** Each user has a unique color theme associated with their profile, making the application visually appealing and easy to navigate.

## Technologies Used

- **Express.js:** A web application framework for Node.js used to handle routing and server-side logic.
- **Body-Parser:** Middleware for parsing incoming request bodies, essential for handling form data.
- **PostgreSQL:** A powerful, open-source relational database used to store user information and visited countries data.
- **ejs:** Embedded JavaScript templating engine used for rendering dynamic HTML pages with data from the server.
